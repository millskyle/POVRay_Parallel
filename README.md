#POVRay Parallel

##What is this?
This set of scripts aids in speeding up large, computationally intense POVRay renders by splitting the rendering up into 100 separate tiles which can then be rendered by separate processes, either on entirely different computers, or on separate nodes in a cluster.  


##How to use:

Copy the directory render_template/.  This will be your working directory for the render.
>   cp render_template/ my_image/
